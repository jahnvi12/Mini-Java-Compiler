Any comments on your implementation strategy:
To compile: javac P2.java from this directory
To run java P2<inp >out
Wanted to implement 2 different symbol tables inheriting from a base table for methods and classes, so that space for methods, etc from symboltable are not allocated to methodSymbolTables. Unfortunately, variables are resolved statically which made it difficult to pass args. Therefore, a slightly space inefficient implementation has been used.
