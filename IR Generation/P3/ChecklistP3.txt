Any other comments:

This assignment builds upon the type checker used in the previous assignment. A new data structure called ObjectTable has been used with vTable and var_fields as discussed in the class. The table is built from parent to child to ensure that the offset for a function remains the same for a parent or a child to take into account the inheritance cases.
